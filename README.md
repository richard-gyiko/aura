# üåü Welcome to Aura - My Personal AI Assistant Journey! 

Hey there! üëã Welcome to my open-source project where I'm documenting my journey of creating Aura, my personal AI assistant. This project represents my exploration into building an AI companion that helps me with everyday developer tasks.

## üéØ Vision
Starting with simple email management tasks, Aura is designed to grow and evolve, continuously expanding its capabilities to become a more comprehensive developer assistant. This is just the beginning of an exciting journey where I'll be pushing the boundaries of what's possible with AI assistance in development workflows.

## üìö Follow Along
I'm sharing my experiences, challenges, and learnings through a series of blog posts on Medium. If you're interested in the behind-the-scenes of building an AI assistant, or want to learn from my experiences, check out my articles:
